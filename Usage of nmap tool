### **Script Description:**

This Python script is a **network scanner tool** that uses **Nmap** for discovering open ports, service versions, and other details of a target host. It provides various customizable scanning options and can be used for basic penetration testing or network auditing.

#### **Detailed Breakdown of the Script:**

1. **Imports:**

   * `nmap`: The Nmap library is used to perform the network scans.
   * `re`: Regular expressions are used to validate the input data (IP address and port range).

2. **Input Validation:**

   * The script checks if the entered target IP address is in the correct format using a regular expression (`ip_pattern`).
   * Similarly, it validates the port range (e.g., 20-100) to ensure it’s within valid limits.

3. **Scan Type Selection:**

   * The script offers several scan types (TCP SYN, TCP Connect, and UDP scans). These are selected by the user based on their requirements.

4. **Additional Scan Options:**

   * The user can opt to gather additional information like:

     * **Service Version Info**: Identifying the versions of services running on open ports.
     * **Operating System Info**: Detecting the OS running on the target host.
     * **Connection Type**: Showing the scan method used for the test.

5. **Scanner Initialization:**

   * The script initializes a `nmap.PortScanner()` object to perform the scan.

6. **Scanning Process:**

   * For each selected scan type, the script performs the scan, checking for open ports and gathering additional information (if enabled).
   * The script prints out details about the target’s **open ports**, **service version information**, and **operating system** (if requested).

7. **Specific Port Check:**

   * The script allows the user to scan a specific port (TCP or UDP) to check its status individually.

8. **Outputs:**

   * The results of the scan are displayed in a user-friendly format, showing whether the host is online, the open ports, and if service version and OS information is enabled, those details as well.
   * If a port is filtered, unreachable, or closed, the script indicates this.

#### **Summary:**

This Python script is a **customizable network scanning tool** that allows the user to:

1. Perform **port scans** on a target IP.
2. Select from **different types of scans** (TCP SYN, TCP Connect, and UDP).
3. Collect and display **service version information** and **operating system details**.
4. Check for a **specific port** status (TCP/UDP).
5. Provide clear outputs to help understand the target host's status.

This tool can be useful for anyone conducting basic network security assessments, system admins looking for open ports or vulnerabilities, or even enthusiasts learning about network scanning and penetration testing.






**** USAGE ****

 Step1 : git clone <url>

 Step2 : cd NMAP-TOOL

 Step3 : chmod +x Networkmap.py

 Step4 : pip install python-nmap

 Step5 : python3 Networkmap.py

 Step6 : we can find found out what we want to see in the nmap like version,operating system, open ports
